# Kafka Connector for Node-RED 🌐⚡  

This repository provides a **Kafka Connector** for **Node-RED**, enabling seamless integration between Kafka message streams and Node-RED workflows. It allows users to create, process, and manage Kafka streams through the Node-RED GUI.

---

## Features ✨  

- **Kafka Integration**: Publish and consume messages from Kafka topics.  
- **Node-RED Workflow Management**: Easily integrate Kafka streams into Node-RED workflows.  
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Set up Kafka brokers, topics, and message handlers through the GUI.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- **Node.js** (16+ recommended).  
- **Node-RED** installed globally:  
  npm install -g node-red  

- A running **Kafka broker** (e.g., Apache Kafka).  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kafka-connector-node-red.git  
cd kafka-connector-node-red  

2. Install dependencies:  
npm install  

3. Link the connector to Node-RED:  
npm link  

4. Start Node-RED:  
node-red  

5. Access the Node-RED interface:  
http://localhost:1880  

---

## Usage 🔧  

1. **Add Kafka Nodes**:  
   - In the Node-RED interface, search for "Kafka" in the palette and drag the **Kafka Input** or **Kafka Output** nodes into your workflow.  

2. **Configure Kafka Nodes**:  
   - Set the broker, topic, and other settings directly in the node configuration panel.  

3. **Integrate with Workflows**:  
   - Connect Kafka nodes to other Node-RED nodes to process, transform, or route messages.  

4. **Deploy the Workflow**:  
   - Click "Deploy" to start processing Kafka messages.

## Example Workflow 🌟  

1. Kafka Input Node → JSON Parser Node → Debug Node.  
   - **Kafka Input**: Subscribes to a Kafka topic and receives messages.  
   - **JSON Parser**: Parses incoming messages as JSON.  
   - **Debug**: Logs the parsed message to the debug console.
